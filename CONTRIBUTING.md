## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.7
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.21

### Setting up the Provider for Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/astronomer/terraform-provider-astro.git
   cd terraform-provider-astro
   ```

2. Build the provider:
   ```
   make dep
   make build
   ```

3. Create a `.terraformrc` file in your home directory (`~`) with the following content:
   ```hcl
   provider_installation {
     dev_overrides {
       "registry.terraform.io/astronomer/astro" = "/path/to/your/terraform-provider-astro/bin"
     }
     direct {}
   }
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/terraform-provider-astro/bin` with the actual path to the `bin` directory in your cloned repository.

4. Create a `main.tf` file for testing:
   ```hcl
   terraform {
     required_providers {
       astro = {
         source = "astronomer/astro"
       }
     }
   }

   provider "astro" {
     organization_id = "<your-org-id>"
   }

   # Add resources and data sources here for testing
   ```

5. Set up your Astro API token:
   ```
   export ASTRO_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
   ```

## Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes in the appropriate files. Common areas for changes include:
    - `internal/provider/` for provider logic
    - `internal/resources/` for resource implementations
    - `internal/datasources/` for data source implementations
    - `examples/` for example configurations

3. Update or add tests in the corresponding `*_test.go` files. If a new data source or resource is added, create a new test file in the `*_test.go` file for that feature.

4. Update documentation if your changes affect the provider's behavior or add new features.

## Testing

1. Run unit tests:
   ```
   make test
   ```

2. Run acceptance tests (these will create real resources in your Astro account):
   ```
   make testacc
   ```
   Note: Ensure all required environment variables are set as described in `internal/provider/provider_test_utils.go`.

3. Test your changes manually using the `main.tf` file you created earlier:
   ```
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of your changes"
   ```

2. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Open a pull request on GitHub.

4. In your pull request description, include:
    - A clear description of the changes
    - Any related issue numbers
    - Steps to test the changes
    - Screenshots or code snippets if applicable

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug or have a suggestion for improvement, please create an issue on the GitHub repository. This helps us track and address problems efficiently.

### Creating an Issue

1. Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/astronomer/terraform-provider-astro/issues) of the repository.
2. Click on "New Issue".
3. Choose the appropriate issue template if available, or start with a blank issue.
4. Provide a clear and concise title that summarizes the issue.
5. In the description, include:
    - A detailed description of the bug or feature request
    - Steps to reproduce the issue (for bugs)
    - Expected behavior
    - Actual behavior (for bugs)
    - Screenshots or error messages, if applicable
    - Your environment details:
        - Terraform version
        - Terraform Provider Astro version
        - Operating System
        - Any other relevant information
6. Add appropriate labels to the issue (e.g., "bug", "enhancement", "documentation")
7. Submit the issue

### Best Practices for Issue Reporting

- Search existing issues before creating a new one to avoid duplicates.
- One issue per report. If you have multiple bugs or feature requests, create separate issues for each.
- Be responsive to questions or requests for additional information.
- If you find a solution to your problem before the issue is resolved, add a comment describing the solution for others who might encounter the same issue.

### Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Email security@astronomer.io instead.

## Best Practices

- Follow Go best practices and conventions.
- Ensure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
- Keep your changes focused. If you're working on multiple features, submit separate pull requests.
- Update the README.md if your changes affect the overall usage of the provider.
- Add example configurations to the `examples/` directory for any new features or resources.
- If you're adding a new resource or data source, ensure you've added corresponding acceptance tests.
