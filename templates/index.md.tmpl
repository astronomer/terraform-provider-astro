# Astro Provider
[Astro](https://www.astronomer.io/product/) is a unified data platform built on Apache Airflow® that ensures data is delivered on time, securely, and accurately.
This is the official [Astro Terraform Provider](https://github.com/astronomer/terraform-provider-astro), built to allow you to automate, scale, and manage your Astro infrastructure.
Reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and create a more streamlined approach to managing data orchestration.

## Authentication
Create an [API token](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/automation-authentication#step-1-create-an-api-token) with the minimum required [permissions](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/user-permissions) to securely use Terraform, ensuring it only has access to the resources necessary.
You can create a [Deployment](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/deployment-api-tokens), [Workspace](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/workspace-api-tokens), or [Organizaton](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/organization-api-tokens) API token. 
An Organizaton token is the most flexible option for authenticating high level changes and touching multiple different resources.
Ensure the API token is configured as an environment variable `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` when running Terraform commands.
