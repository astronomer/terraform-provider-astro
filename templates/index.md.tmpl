# Astro Provider
[Astro](https://www.astronomer.io/product/) is a unified data platform built on Apache AirflowÂ® that ensures data is delivered on time, securely, and accurately.
This is the official [Astro Terraform Provider](https://github.com/astronomer/terraform-provider-astro), built to allow you to automate, scale, and manage your Astro infrastructure.
Reduce manual effort, minimize errors, and create a more streamlined approach to managing data orchestration.

## Authentication
Create an [API token](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/automation-authentication#step-1-create-an-api-token) with the minimum required [permissions](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/user-permissions) to securely use Terraform, ensuring it only has access to the resources necessary.
You can create a [Deployment](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/deployment-api-tokens), [Workspace](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/workspace-api-tokens), or [Organizaton](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/organization-api-tokens) API token. 
An Organizaton token is the most flexible option to authenticate for high level changes accross multiple different resources.
Astronomer recommends that you configure your API token as an environment variable, `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` when running Terraform commands.
