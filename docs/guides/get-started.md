# Get started with Astro Terraform Provider
This guide shows you how to automate the onboarding of a new team onto Astro by creating and managing a Workspace and Deployment. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully automated setup that is reproducible and easily scalable to more teams.

## Prerequisites
- An Astro Organization
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)


## Step 1: Create Your Terraform Working Directory
1. Create a folder, `my-data-platform` for your Terraform project.
2. Save the following code in a file named `terraform.tf`:
```
terraform {
  required_providers {
    astro = {
      source  = "astronomer/astro"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "astro" {
  organization_id = &lt;your-organization-id&gt;
}
```
3. Edit the `terraform.tf` file with your Organization's ID for `<your-organization-id>`. The working directory contains all your Terraform code, and all Terraform commands run from this directory.

## Step 2: Initialize the Terraform Working Directory
1. Run `terraform init`. You will see Terraform downloading and installing the Astro Terraform provider locally:
```
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding astronomer/astro versions matching "1.0.0"...
- Installing astronomer/astro v1.0.0...
- Installed astronomer/astro v1.0.0 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID F5206453FDEA33CF)

...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
```
2. Terraform stores the versions and hashes of providers in a generated file `.terraform.lock.hcl`.

-> Astronomer recommends you store `.terraform.lock.hcl` in your version control system so that you can track potential changes to your external dependencies.

## Step 3: Authenticate with Astro
1. [Create an API token](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/automation-authentication#step-1-create-an-api-token) in Astro. Since you are creating a Workspace, you need an [Organization API token](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/organization-api-tokens) with [Organization Owner permissions](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/astro/user-permissions#organization-roles).
2. Configure the API token as an environment variable `ASTRO_API_TOKEN` to run Terraform commands:
`export ASTRO_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>`

Alternatively, you can set their API token value in the provider block:
```
provider "astro" {
  organization_id = "&lt;your-organization-id&gt;"
  token = "&lt;your-api-token&gt;"
}
```

## Step 4: Define Resources in Terraform
In a file `main.tf`, define two resources, an `astro_workspace` and an `astro_deployment`. These resources represent an Astro Workspace and Astro Deployment, defined in Terraform code:
```
# Create a new workspace
resource "astro_workspace" "my_first_tf_workspace" {
  name                  = "My first TF workspace"
  description           = "My first Terraform-created workspace"
  cicd_enforced_default = false
}

# Create a new Deployment
resource "astro_deployment" "my_first_tf_deployment" {
  name                    = "My first TF deployment"
  description             = "My first Terraform-created deployment"
  type                    = "STANDARD"
  cloud_provider          = "AWS"
  region                  = "us-east-1"
  contact_emails          = []
  default_task_pod_cpu    = "0.25"
  default_task_pod_memory = "0.5Gi"
  executor                = "CELERY"
  is_cicd_enforced        = true
  is_dag_deploy_enabled   = true
  is_development_mode     = false
  is_high_availability    = false
  resource_quota_cpu      = "10"
  resource_quota_memory   = "20Gi"
  scheduler_size          = "SMALL"
  workspace_id            = astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace.id
  environment_variables   = []
  worker_queues = [{
    name               = "default"
    is_default         = true
    astro_machine      = "A5"
    max_worker_count   = 10
    min_worker_count   = 0
    worker_concurrency = 1
  }]
}
```
-> One of the key characteristics (and benefits) of using Terraform is that it's *declarative*. For example, `workspace_id = astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace.id` tells Terraform to configure the Workspace ID in the Deployment. This means the Workspace must be created first, producing an ID which is a generated value and unknown at the time you initially define the resources in Terraform. You don't have to instruct Terraform to create resources in a certain order, you only have to instruct what to create. You can define the resources in the previous code example in any order. Terraform takes the relationships between resources into account when deciding the order of creating resources.

## Step 5: (Optional) Define Outputs
In a file called `outputs.tf`, define values you want to log after creating the infrastructure. The following code configures Workspace and Deployment IDs as the output:
```
output "terraform_workspace" {
  description = "ID of the TF created workspace"
  value       = astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace.id
}

output "terraform_deployment" {
  description = "ID of the TF created deployment"
  value       = astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment.id
}
```

## Step 6: Preview the Terraform changes
You now have up to three files: `terraform.tf`, `main.tf`, and the optional `outputs.tf`.
1. Run [`terraform plan`](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan) to let Terraform create an execution plan, so you can preview the infrastructure changes that Terraform will make. As Terraform makes a plan, it shares a summary of the plan as an output similar to the following text:
```
$ terraform plan

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment will be created
  + resource "astro_deployment" "my_first_tf_deployment" {
      ...
    }

  # astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace will be created
  + resource "astro_workspace" "my_first_tf_workspace" {
      ...
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  + terraform_deployment = (known after apply)
  + terraform_workspace  = (known after apply)
  ```
2. Verify that the generated plan contains the text `Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.` This confirms that `main.tf` creates two new resources. In this case, a Workspace and a Deployment.

## Step 7: Apply the Terraform Plan
Run `terraform apply` and select `yes` to execute the plan. This creates the Astro resources and prints their ids, as you defined in `outputs.tf`: 
```
$ terraform apply

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

...

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace: Creating...
astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace: Creation complete after 0s [id=&lt;workspace-id&gt]
astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment: Creating...
astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment: Creation complete after 1s [id=&lt;deployment-id&gt]

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

terraform_deployment = "&lt;deployment-id&gt"
terraform_workspace = "&lt;workspace-id&gt"
```
The resources were created and are now visible in Astro.

## Step 8: Clean Up Terraform-Created Resources
Run `terraform destroy` and select `yes`:
```
$ terraform destroy
astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace: Refreshing state...
  [id=&lt;workspace-id&gt]
astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment: Refreshing state...
  [id=&lt;deployment-id&gt]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  - destroy

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  ...

Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

Changes to Outputs:
  - terraform_deployment = "&lt;deployment-id&gt" -> null
  - terraform_workspace  = "&lt;workspace-id&gt" -> null

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: yes

astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment: Destroying...
  [id=&lt;deployment-id&gt]
astro_deployment.my_first_tf_deployment: Destruction complete after 1s
astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace: Destroying...
  [id=&lt;workspace-id&gt]
astro_workspace.my_first_tf_workspace: Destruction complete after 0s

Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
```
The output shows two destroyed resources, which are the Workspace and Deployment that you first created.
